# Software Testing
This space is dedicated to Software Testing. Its a place to keep notes about software testing and scripts for further reference.

At the moment, there are notes on software testing in general, and test driven development (TDD). Please note that this is a work in progress that'd be updated in no specific frame of time.   

Most of the material in here has been extracted from content provided by:
1. [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s - *Software Testing* course
2. [Aaron Maxwell](http://redsymbol.net/)'s - *Test Driven Development in Python* book
3. [AgileData](http://www.agiledata.org/) by Scott Wambler
4. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)

This list will grow as more material is added to the repository.

Any contributors or contributions are more than welcome.
